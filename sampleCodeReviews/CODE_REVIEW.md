### Gemini-Pro Review
| Metric                  | Comments           |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Quality                 | 75       |
| Format and Readability  | The code is well-formatted and readable. It uses consistent indentation and spacing, and the variable and function names are descriptive. However, there are some areas where the code could be more concise, such as the use of nested divs in the LoginScreenWithDropdown component. |
| Component Structure     | The component structure is well-organized. The LoginScreenWithDropdown component is responsible for rendering the entire login screen, and it uses nested components to represent the different sections of the screen. However, the component could be further broken down into smaller, more reusable components.   |
| Responsiveness and Styling | The code uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which makes it easy to create responsive designs. However, the code does not include any specific media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. The styling is also somewhat basic, and it could be improved by using more advanced CSS techniques. |
| Accessibility          | The code does not include any accessibility features. It is important to consider accessibility when developing web applications, as it ensures that the application is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. The code should include ARIA attributes and other accessibility features to make the application more accessible. |
| Code Reusability       | The code is not very reusable. The LoginScreenWithDropdown component is specific to the login screen, and it is not easily adaptable to other use cases. The code could be made more reusable by extracting common components and functions. |
| Performance            | The code does not include any performance optimizations. It is important to consider performance when developing web applications, as it ensures that the application is fast and responsive. The code could be optimized by using techniques such as lazy loading and code splitting.   |
| Best Practices         | The code follows some best practices, such as using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. However, there are some areas where the code could be improved, such as the use of accessibility features and the lack of performance optimizations. |

### GPT-4 Review
| Metric                  | Comments           |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Quality                 | 65       |
| Format and Readability  | The code is generally well-formatted with consistent indentation and use of whitespace. However, there are redundant CSS rules in 'compiled-styles.css' which could be cleaned up for better readability. |
| Component Structure     | The codebase is organized into components, but the 'LoginScreenWithDropdown' component could be further broken down into smaller, more reusable components. This would improve maintainability and scalability.   |
| Responsiveness and Styling | The use of Tailwind CSS suggests responsiveness, but the hardcoded values in the 'LoginScreenWithDropdown' component might limit flexibility across different screen sizes. The styling is consistent, but the use of multiple background colors for similar elements could be harmonized. |
| Accessibility          | The code lacks explicit accessibility features such as ARIA labels and roles, which are crucial for users with disabilities. There is also no mention of keyboard accessibility or sufficient color contrast checks. |
| Code Reusability       | The code shows some modularity, especially with the use of components in React. However, the 'LoginScreenWithDropdown' component has a high level of specificity which might limit reusability. |
| Performance            | The use of modern frameworks like React and Vite suggests good performance, but there are no explicit optimizations mentioned, such as lazy loading or efficient resource management.   |
| Best Practices         | The code uses modern tools and frameworks, and follows some best practices in terms of modular design. However, improvements could be made in error handling, security aspects, and avoiding redundancy in CSS. |

|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Quality                 | 75       |
| Format and Readability  | The code follows a consistent indentation and uses appropriate whitespace, making it easy to read. The use of meaningful variable and function names enhances code comprehension. However, the code could benefit from more comments to provide additional context and clarity. |
| Component Structure     | The code is organized into a single component, LoginScreenWithDropdown, which encapsulates the entire login screen functionality. While this is suitable for a small-scale application, as the application grows, it would be beneficial to break down the component into smaller, reusable sub-components for better maintainability and modularity.   |
| Responsiveness and Styling | The code utilizes Tailwind CSS classes to style the components, which promotes a consistent and responsive design. The use of flex layout and responsive classes ensures that the login screen adapts well to different screen sizes. However, the code could be enhanced by extracting the inline styles into separate CSS classes for better separation of concerns. |
| Accessibility          | The code lacks explicit accessibility considerations. It would be beneficial to include appropriate ARIA attributes and ensure that the form elements are properly labeled and navigable using keyboard controls. Additionally, the color contrast between the text and background colors should be reviewed to meet accessibility standards. |
| Code Reusability       | The code demonstrates some level of reusability by extracting the LoginScreenWithDropdown component. However, there is room for improvement in terms of creating smaller, reusable sub-components for the input fields, buttons, and other UI elements. This would promote code reuse and maintainability. |
| Performance            | The code appears to be efficient in terms of performance. It does not contain any obvious performance bottlenecks or unnecessary computations. However, as the application scales, it would be important to monitor and optimize performance, especially when handling user interactions and data fetching.   |
| Best Practices         | The code follows some best practices, such as using TypeScript for type safety and utilizing a popular CSS framework (Tailwind CSS) for styling. However, there are areas where best practices could be further applied. For example, implementing proper error handling, form validation, and security measures like input sanitization and protection against common vulnerabilities would enhance the overall code quality and robustness. |
